# 20260922_E4_pi0_reduce-overhead+step_only_N4

* **What:** E4 — task T003
* **Conditions:** date 2026-09-22T00:19:46Z, power mode NV Power Mode: MAXN, model pi0 (LeRobot implementation)
* **Command:** `TORCH_LOGS=graph_breaks,recompiles python bench/run_e4.py --mode reduce-overhead --variant step_only --steps 4,10 --warmup 20 --timed 100`

**Anything odd:** regions_note: Region instrumentation is OFF: bench/regions.py uses Python context managers and dynamo cannot inline contextlib.__enter__, so every region boundary becomes a graph break and an instrumented compiled ; notes: ['ae_layer[j] instrumentation is OFF in E4 (it costs the step it lands on ~2.6 ms — T002 review finding).', 'Under CUDA graphs the per-region CUDA events may be absorbed into the graph; where ae_total; emc_hz_note: emc_hz reads 0 in these runs: `sudo -n cat /sys/kernel/debug/...` returned empty under the driver's environment. The EMC clock was 3,199,000,000 Hz in T001/T002 on the same unchanged device state.
